To connect all of us globally we have a Slack workspace as a venue for journal club organizers to collaborate. Local organizers participate by posting in Slack, engaging with or proposing new materials such as topic-specific reading lists, or joining global online meetups. We also have a speaker swap program which encourages ReproducibiliTea members to present in journal clubs other than the one local to them.
