We are working to strengthen the collaborations between ReproducibiliTea clubs via four avenues:
* Slack workspace - To connect all of us globally (Local organizers participate by posting in Slack, engaging with or proposing new materials such as topic-specific reading lists, or joining global online meetups)
* The Speaker Swap program which encourages ReproducibiliTea members to present in journal clubs other than the one local to them
* We encourage collaborations via ReproducibiliTea Collaborations 
* We have introduced the idea of [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://reproducibilitea.org/special-interest-groups)

* Reading Lists
