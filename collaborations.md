We are working to strengthen the collaborations between ReproducibiliTea clubs via four avenues:
* Slack workspace - to connect all of us globally (local organizers participate by posting in Slack, engaging with or proposing new materials such as topic-specific reading lists, or joining global online meetups)
* Speaker Swap program which encourages ReproducibiliTea members to present in journal clubs other than the one local to them
* ReproducibiliTea Collaborations 
* [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://reproducibilitea.org/special-interest-groups) (in preparation)
<br><br>


* ReproducibiliTea Bordeaux
* Existing Collaborations
