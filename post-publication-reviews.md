The steering committee provides resources to make it as easy as possible to start: a list with suggested review targets, peer review guidelines and recommendations, as well as a list of venues where commentaries could be published and a list of funding opportunities.

Because this project is still in its pilot phase (start January 2025), these documents are not publicly available yet. Interested in participating in the project? Send us an email: reproducibilitea@gmail.com and we will send you more information including resources.
