  "body": "Dear {{ jcTitle }} organisers,\n\nWe have tried to contact you several times over the last few months to let you know that you need to update your journal club details. We received no response, so we have now <strong>deactivated your journal club</strong>. Deactivation means your journal club is no longer listed on the website, and if another member of your institution wishes to start a new journal club there we will hand the resources over to them.\n\nIf you would like your journal club reinstated, please reply to this email and let us know.\n\nThanks,\nThe ReproducibiliTea Steering Committee"
