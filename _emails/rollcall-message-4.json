  "body": "Dear {{ jcTitle }} organisers,\n\nWe have tried to contact you twice over the last two months to let you know that you need to update your journal club details. We are now <strong>preparing to deactivate your journal club</strong>. Deactivation means your journal club will no longer be listed on the website, and if another member of your institution wishes to start a new journal club there we will hand the resources over to them. You can avoid deactivation by simply updating the journal club details on our website, as explained below.\\n\\nIf you've recently updated your journal club and it hasn't worked properly, please reply to this email to let us know!\n\nWhether or not anything in your journal club has changed, you need to visit <a href=\"https://reproducibiliTea.org/join-reproducibilitea/edit-jc/\">this link</a> and request an edit token. Once you have your token you can check the details of your journal club. Just submit the form if everything is okay!\n\nThanks,\nThe ReproducibiliTea Steering Committee"
