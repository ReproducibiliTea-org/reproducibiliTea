  "body": "Dear {{ jcTitle }} organisers,</br></br>We wrote to you recently to tell you that we need you to check the details we have online for your ReproducibiliTea journal club.</br></br>It's important for us to have the details correct so that we can keep you up to date with what's going on, so that people can find out about your journal club online, and so that we can present an accurate picture of how ReproducibiliTea journal clubs are spreading throughout the world.</br></br>In order to keep our records straight, we deactivate journal clubs which aren't kept up to date. If you don't update your journal club in the next month or so, we will deactivate it, which means it will no longer be listed on the website. If you've recently updated your journal club and it hasn't worked properly, please reply to this email to let us know!</br></br>Whether or not anything in your journal club has changed, please visit <a href=\"https://reproducibiliTea.org/join-reproducibilitea/edit-jc/\">this link</a> to request an edit token. Once you have your token you can check the details of your journal club. Just submit the form if everything is okay!</br></br>Thanks,</br>The ReproducibiliTea Steering Committee"
