You want to get into Open Science? Welcome!

We all started somewhere and know it can be daunting. Here are three ways to make it as easy and painless as possible!



## Way 1: Want to start your own journal club?

Do it! It's a low commitment, fun and flexible way to start spreading Open Science ideas in your department. It allows you to learn the fundamentals together with the people you work with. Making it easier to implement new ideas and practices.
We also have an active Slack community where ReproducibiliTea organizers support each other.

We have an [OSF page <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://osf.io/3qrj6/wiki/home/) where you can download all the necessary materials that you can freely share and adapt. There you will find:
- A welcome letter telling you more about ReproducibiliTea
- The ReproducibiliTea Logo
- Various ReproducibiliTea poster templates
- A sample checklist for organising your own Journal Club
- Our [reading lists <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/) on many Open Science topics
- And much much more ...

<!---
We also maintain a [central Zotero library <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea/items/) with collections for each individual journal club, as well as a folder of suggestions for [introductory papers <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i></sup>](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea/items/collectionKey/5EMUTRWM) for the first few journal clubs.

## Way 2: Want to join an existing journal club?
