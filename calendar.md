# ReproducibiliTea Online

Many Journal Clubs meet (partly) online and are happy to welcome guests! 

The ReproducibiliTea calendar below lists online journal club sessions and events which are open to wider participation. Spaces at events may be limited, and will be distributed at the discretion of the organisers. See an event's details for more information on how to attend.
