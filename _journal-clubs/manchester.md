**About:**
The journal club is open to everyone across the the University of Manchester and nearby universities, from any discipline, career stage, or department.

During the COVID-19 pandemic we are meeting on the second Wednesday of every month at 11am on Zoom. Details of online sessions for Manchester and many other institutions can be found [here](https://reproducibilitea.org/calendar)!

The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/bs2k7/wiki/home/), and we circulate the meeting details through the university's Open Research mailing list which you can join [by signing up here](https://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=open_research&A=1). 

We also have a Google calendar which you can [find here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=reprotmanc%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) or add to your own calendar by following [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=cmVwcm90bWFuY0BnbWFpbC5jb20).

**The format:**
For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5-15mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees.

**Inclusivity:**
Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike!
We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views views from all perspectives.
Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!
