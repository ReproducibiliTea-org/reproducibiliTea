In the upcoming semester, we will meet every second or third Thursday, from 5 pm to 6 pm. A meeting begins with a short presentation about the paper we read, followed by a discussion. Everyone and every perspective is welcome!

Please get in touch via email! 3 ECTS can be obtained for regular participation. Read the paper and come by for tea and discussion!

Next meetings: Our first meeting will be on 21 October.
