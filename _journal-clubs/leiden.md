**About**

The ReproducibiliTea journal club is a member initiative of the *Open Science Community Leiden (OSCL)*. We discuss papers related to open science, replication, and of course reproducibility. Our journal club is open to anyone affiliated with Leiden University, no matter their background, discipline, or career status.

Anyone whoâ€™s never heard the term *open science* before is particularly welcome! No sign-up needed - just **join OSCL Teams channel**.

**Mission**

- Discuss methodological issues in the social sciences and beyond, and potential ways forward
- Familiarize ourselves with open science tools and methods
- Connect engaged students and researchers from various specializations

**Format**

During each session, one member volunteers to host. That member will prepare a short introduction to the paper/preprint/blog post and facilitate discussion. Do we at all agree with the author's claims? How do we integrate the findings into our own research? How can we broaden this topic to include all research fields of our members? 

We want to stimulate open, critical conversations, and *encourage* but don't expect participants to read the paper beforehand. Of course, everyone is free to contribute as much time, effort, or input as they wish.

**Practical information**

Our monthly-ish sessions are currently hosted online, at the Open Science Community MS Teams channel. If you're not sure how to find it, or have any questions, shoot us an [**email**](mailto:Leiden.Tea@gmail.com). 
Stay up to date by joining our [**mailing list**](https://gmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a401739a818a4ec097d309263&id=d1c0b4e5f8) and [**twitter**](http://twitter.com/LeidenTea).
