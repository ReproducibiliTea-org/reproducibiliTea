**About:** 

The ReproducibiliTea journal club is a member initiative of the Open Science Community Leiden. We'll kick off on Thursday, 21st November, 4-6pm, location tba. Our journal club is open to anyone affiliated with Leiden University, no matter the background, discipline, or place in the hierarchy.

Anyone who's never heard the term "open science" before is particularly welcome!

**The mission:**

* introduce ourselves to methodological issues in the social sciences and beyond, and discuss potential ways forward
* learn about open science practices and help each other familiar with those
* connect students and researchers from various specializations who are interested in open science

**The format:**

Each session, a presenter will give a short overview of today's paper, and prepare some highlights she/he finds interesting and worth a discussion. Everyone is free to contribute as much time, effort, or input as they wish.

**The rules:**

1st RULE: You do talk about the journal club.

2nd RULE: You **DO** talk about the **journal club**.

3rd RULE: If someone says "Huh?" or goes quiet, please explain what you mean.

4th RULE: Only discussion, no grading, no judging.

5th RULE: One person talking at a time, don't interrupt, don't give dismissive looks or comments.

6th RULE: Many questions, many ideas. We're all trying to learn from each other.

7th RULE: Discussions may go on as long as it has to. You are allowed to come late or leave early, because we're aware that people may have other responsibilities.

8th RULE: If this is your first time at the journal club, you're especially welcome.
