### **Welcome**

Our journal club is open to both staff and students at UiO across all departments. Everyone is welcome to join us - whether you are an enthusiast, a skeptic, or a cautious explorer. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested to participate or contribute!

### Our mission

-   provide an informal and friendly platform for discussions about meta scientific topics
-   help each other get familiarized with open science practices (e.g., pre-registrations, sharing data, sharing preprints, etc.)
-   connect students and researchers from various disciplines who are interested in meta science.

### Format

Before each meeting, we read an article on meta scientific topics, which we then discuss during the meeting. At each meeting, a different discussion leader will begin by providing a short overview of the paper and facilitate discussion throughout the meeting. Anyone can propose a possible paper or topic to present if we have not covered it already. Grab a cup of tea (coffee?) and join us! Due to the current pandemic, all sessions will be held online (Zoom) for the time being.
