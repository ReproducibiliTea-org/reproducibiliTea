  Change journal club name from "Sydney" to "Macquarie"

The Macquarie branch of RTea is based at Macquarie University with primary input from the Departments of Psychology and Cognitive Science. The RTea journal clubs form a key part of the Macquarie Methods and Meta-science meetings (Triple M meetings). The format for triple M meetings is a mixture of RTea journal clubs and talks. 

Talks are welcome in a range of formats. It can be a summary of something recent in your lab that speaks to open science or a how-to talk that demonstrates a new methodological, theoretical, statistical or more general data-science approach. External speakers will be invited at various points also.

This is an inclusive meeting, and all are welcome. We are particularly keen to have a strong masters, PhD and early career presence at these meetings. Anyone can propose a possible topic and present, so please do come along and get involved.
