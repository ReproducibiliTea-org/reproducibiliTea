We are MIT BCS ReproducibiliTea, a community of graduate students, postdocs, research staff, and faculty who care about open science and rigor in MIT's Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. We started in Spring 2024 with a small group, and have recently expanded. We meet about once a month to discuss topics such as mistakes, experimental design, and code and data management.
