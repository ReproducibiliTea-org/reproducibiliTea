Lancaster University's Psychology Department and the PROSPR group (Promoting Open Science Practices) launched the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club in July 2019. We meet twice a month during term time to discuss key papers on open science and reproducibility issues. All are welcome regardless of the experience and career status!
