# The University of Bristol ReproducibiliTea journal club 

Inspired by the original [Oxford club]({{"/journal-clubs/#Oxford" | relative_url}}) ReproducibiliTea came to Bristol in January 2019 with the support of the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN), which is now spreading to other universities.

We run an ECR-led weekly journal club open to all staff and students from any discipline.

## Time & Place

Every other Monday, 4-5pm, via Zoom

## Format

In advance of each session, one attendee chooses a paper related to the barriers and solutions to better research methods in the life sciences. During the session the attendee presents a short (~15mins) overview of the chosen paper and the remainder of the session is dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees.

## Inclusivity

Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and open science enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds.

## How to join

To join the mailing list please email the club organiser, Benji Woolf (Benjamin.woolf@bristol.ac.uk)
