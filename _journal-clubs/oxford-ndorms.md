  Hi Matt!
        
  If you could please make the changes below to the NDORMS page, that would be very much appreciated:
        
  1) Wherever there is NDORMS (title or description), please change it to Clinical Research.
    
  2) We will meet online, every other Wednesday of the academic term, from 2-3 pm. So, if you could also update that in the description, it would be awesome.
    
  3) Please put James as the main contact for this journal club.
    
  Many thanks in advance!
  Michael
