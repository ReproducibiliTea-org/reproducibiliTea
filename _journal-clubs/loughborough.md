Our first session will take place on the 6th February at 10:30am in the Doctoral College Training Room. The most up-to-date information can be found on our [Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/LoughboroughTea/), you can sign up through the Doctoral Developmental Portal (PhD students), send us an [Email](k.burdenski@lboro.ac.uk) or simply pop by.

**The format:**
The sessions are a combination of discussing journal article and introducing new, innovative research methods. We go with the flow and look forward to incorporating everyone's interests into the session plan. For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5-15 minutes) presentation with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion among all attendees.

**Inclusivity:** 
Everyone is welcome to join us- skeptics and enthusiasts alike. We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines and backgrounds and look forward to learning from each other.
