ReproducibiliTea Leipzig journal club is a space to discuss various aspects related to Open Science practices. We meet every other Wednesday (3-4 pm) to discuss articles, which are selected to touch upon possibly versatile Open Science topics, from general issues to specific applications, presenting both enthusiastic and critical perspectives. If you look for an opportunity to broaden your knowledge on Open Science, discuss pros and cons, share experiences and get to know other Open Science adopters - feel warmly invited!
