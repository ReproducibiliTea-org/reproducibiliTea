Welcome to the McMaster ReproducibiliTea journal club! We will begin meeting in January 2020 to discuss how we can help make science transparent, reproducible, and cumulative.

Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike! We welcome undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff from all departments and background, and hope to hear views from all perspectives.
