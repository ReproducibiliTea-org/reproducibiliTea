Welcome to the McMaster ReproducibiliTea journal club! We discuss how we can help make science transparent, reproducible, and cumulative.

Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike! We welcome undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff from all departments and background, and hope to hear views from all perspectives.
