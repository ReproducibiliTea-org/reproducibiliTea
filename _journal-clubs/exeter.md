ReproducibiliTea Exeter is focused broadly on transparency and reproducibility in research. 

We meet twice a month in term time (hybrid), and we run a mix of traditional journal club discussion sessions, as well as practical sessions, where we try out things like data visualisation with R, preregistering studies, open data sharing, and more.
