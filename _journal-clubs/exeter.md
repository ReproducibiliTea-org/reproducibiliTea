ReproducibiliTea Exeter is focused broadly on transparency and reproducibility in psychology research. 

We meet twice a month in term time, and we run a mix of traditional journal club discussion sessions, as well as ‘practical’ sessions, where we try out things like data visualisation with R, preregistering studies, open data sharing, and more. 

From 2022, we’ll try in-person meetings, so there will even be actual tea (and cake)!
If you want more information or you want to be added to our mailing list, please feel free to email Kathryn at kk451@exeter.ac.uk or Xinran at xd247@exeter.ac.uk!
