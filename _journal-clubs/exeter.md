ReproducibiliTea Exeter is focused broadly on transparency and reproducibility in research. 

We meet twice a month in term time (hybrid), and we run a mix of traditional journal club discussion sessions, as well as practical sessions, where we try out things like data visualisation with R, preregistering studies, open data sharing, and more. 

If you want more information or you want to be added to our mailing list, please feel free to email Kathryn at kk451@exeter.ac.uk or Xinran at xd247@exeter.ac.uk!
