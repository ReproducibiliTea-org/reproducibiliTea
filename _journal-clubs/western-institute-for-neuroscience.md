Our goal is to provide a place for researchers at any stage of their careers (undergraduate, graduate, postdocs, PIs, staff) to explore the principles and practices of open science. Open science promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility, revolutionizing the way research is conducted and shared. Through our journal club, we aim to educate and provide tools to researchers on how to adopt open science methods, understand its myriad benefits, and gain practical insights into implementing them in their own work.
