The Sheffield branch of ReproducibiliTea meets monthly and has people coming from a range of departments across the University of Sheffield and beyond.

Aims

At our sessions, we are aiming to provide an informal, friendly and supportive space to discuss topics related to reproducibility, replicability and transparency, open research practices and research culture change.

Format

Anyone is welcome to propose a paper or topic to discuss. 

During each session, one or more members volunteer to lead the discussion. The volunteer/-s prepare a short introduction to the paper/blog post/talk/topic and facilitate discussion.
