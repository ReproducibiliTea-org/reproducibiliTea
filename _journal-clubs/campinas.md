We are excited to bring the ReproducibiliTea journal club to Brazil! The journal club is open to everyone at São Francisco University (Campinas - Brazil) inside the Psychology Graduate School (staff and students). Everyone is welcome to join us, from novices to experts. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in participating or contributing!

We aim to provide an informal and friendly platform for discussions about open science, reproducibility, and meta-science, 
help each other get familiarized with open science practices and connect students and researchers.

Before each meeting, we read an article, which we then discuss during the meeting. At each meeting, a presenter begins by providing a short overview of the paper and facilitates the discussion throughout the meeting. Anyone can propose a possible paper or topic to present if we have not covered it already. We may also invite guest speakers. Please feel free to reach out to us if you’d like to give us a talk or workshop on anything related to open science, meta-science, and reproducibility.
