Welcome to the Queen Mary ReproducibiliTea! Founded fall 2020, we host various open science and reproducibility-related events and meetings with the goal of improving the trustworthiness of research across a wide range of scientific disciplines.

Get started by emailing Nick (n.b.ballou@qmul.ac.uk) to join the mailing list or stop by our monthly journal club, where we discuss one or more articles about topics ranging from meta-science to scientific fraud to philosophy of science over a (currently socially-distanced) cup of tea or coffee.

All are welcome: from those who have never heard of open science to experts, undergraduates to department heads, linguists to entomologists to computer scientists and beyond.
