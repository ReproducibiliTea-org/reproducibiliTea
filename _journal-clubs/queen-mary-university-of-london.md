Welcome to the Queen Mary ReproducibiliTea! Founded fall 2020, we host various open science and reproducibility-related events and meetings with the goal of improving the trustworthiness of research across a wide range of scientific disciplines.

Get started by joining our mailing list and stop by our monthly journal club, where we discuss one or more articles about topics ranging from meta-science to scientific fraud to philosophy of science over a (currently socially-distanced) cup of tea or coffee.

Sign up using this link (https://forms.gle/9coCMGvPqddkKn5G7) or by emailing Nick (n.b.ballou@qmul.ac.uk).

All are welcome: from those who have never heard of open science to experts, undergraduates to department heads, linguists to entomologists to computer scientists and beyond.
