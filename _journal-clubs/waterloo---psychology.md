Welcome to the University of Waterlooâ€™s Psychology ReproducibiliTea journal club! This club is meant for everyone in the department of psychology and beyond!

We are a new club run by senior grad students and plan to start meeting in the Fall of 2021 on a bi-weekly basis. We look forward to discussing reproducibility concerns in our field as well as practical ways to improve the robustness of one's research, while also making science more reproducible, open, and accessible.
