If you're interested in open research and you're not sure where to start, or if you have plenty of experience and you're willing to share, please join our friendly group. We invite researchers at all levels for interesting conversations!

All of our sessions are hybrid; our physical meeting room is the Archives and Special Collections Training Room at the University of Galway. We encourage researchers from both Atlantic Technological University and University of Galway to attend in person--anyone is welcome online. Readings are listed in our calendar events.
