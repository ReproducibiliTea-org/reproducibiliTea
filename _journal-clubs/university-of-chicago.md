The University of Chicago ReproducibliTea Journal Club meets every two weeks during each quarter to discuss meta-science topics such as reproducibility, open science and others! An initiative started by graduate students and early-career researchers in the Psychology and Neuroscience/Neurobiology departments, we hope to have broad discussions about different aspects of science relevant across disciplines.

To subscribe to our mailing list, please email [William](mailto:wngiam@uchicago.edu) with your @uchicago.edu email.
