The University of Chicago ReproducibliTea Journal Club meets every week during each quarter to discuss meta-science topics such as reproducibility, open science and others! An initiative started by graduate students and early-career researchers in the Psychology department, the goal is to create a supportive community and empower each other to undertake rigorous and open research practices!
