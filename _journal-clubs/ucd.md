Are you interested in Open Science/Open Research? If so, consider dropping by our informal, monthly journal club that takes place in-person on the Belfield campus. All are welcome, especially early career researchers. 

Current readings are available on the UCD CSTAR website. Please read the paper beforehand so that we can have interesting discussions!
