Are you interested in Open Science/Open Research? If so, consider dropping by our informal, monthly journal club that takes place in-person over lunchtime on the Belfield campus. All are welcome, especially early career researchers. 

Current readings are available on our UCD CSTAR website and previous readings will be available in our OSF Repository. Please read the paper beforehand so that we can have interesting discussions!
