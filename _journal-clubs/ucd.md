Are you interested in Open Science/Open Research? If so, consider dropping by our informal, monthly journal club that will take place in-person over lunchtime in Link 3 of the UCD James Joyce Library. All are welcome, especially early career researchers. 

Readings are available in our OSF Repository, UCD CSTAR website and below. Please read the paper beforehand so that we can have interesting discussions!
