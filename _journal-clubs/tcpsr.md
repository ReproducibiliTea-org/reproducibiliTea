TCPSR is the Chinese-speaking community where we wish more Chinese-as-first-language scholars realize and join ReproducibiliTea journal clubs. We expect each mega city in Taiwan will have a standalone journal club. Since 2021 winter, we are managing bimonthly open practices workshops included the pre-research estimations on power, effect size and sample size.
