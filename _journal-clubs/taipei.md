**About us**
The Taipei ReproducibiliTea journal club meets at Taipei Medical University to have open discussions about what might be wrong with the way we are doing science and how to make things better. 

People from an field, at any institution in Taipei, and at any stage of their career are all welcome to come along and join in. 

Bring a cup and enjoy some tea, some biscuits, and some friendly science chat!
