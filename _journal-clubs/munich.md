We have decided to establish a journal club on the topic of Open Science. We meet every three to four weeks. The slogan of our journal club is "ReproJuicebiliTea"
and highlights the topics to be covered and discussed (Reproducibility & Open Science) and our broadened beverage selection.
We will discuss the issue of the "replication crisis", identify necessary improvements
in science and talk about current debates on the theories of science. Tea, juice and snacks will be provided in order to fulfil our motto.

With the Journal Club we would like to address and encourage attendees from all disciplines and at every career step to join the discussion and enable an interdisciplinary exchange. 

Please send us a short mail and we will put you on our mailing list (reproducibilitea.munich@gmail.com)
