Hello and welcome to the Edinburgh branch of ReproducibiliTea! ReproducibiliTea is one of the flagship events of the Edinburgh Open Research Initiative (EORI), which has been running since 2019.

 

From the 2025/26 academic year, we plan to host an open online ReproducibiliTea event every other month (details to follow â€“ or email us for updates!) and focus on local in-person events on the alternating month. These will be paired events on a rotating reproducibility/open research theme. They are designed to be open to researchers of any career/study stage, discipline, or job title/role, and to present engaging content to people of any stage of their journey into reproducible research. We aim to make these events available to sign up on Eventbrite (as well as accessible via Outlook invites to UoE members), and to post regular updates on our social media channels.

 

Follow our updates on BlueSky ([https://bsky.app/profile/edopenresearch.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/edopenresearch.bsky.social)) and LinkedIn ([https://www.linkedin.com/company/library-research-support-university-of-edinburgh/posts/?feedView=all](https://www.linkedin.com/company/library-research-support-university-of-edinburgh/posts/?feedView=all)) which we share with the University of Edinburgh Library Open Research Team. We will update session recordings on our MediaHopper page at UoE ([https://media.ed.ac.uk/search?keyword=reproducibilitea](https://media.ed.ac.uk/search?keyword=reproducibilitea)), as well as blog-style write-ups following the sessions (URL TBC).

 

For any questions or updates, contact us at Edinburgh.ReproducibiliTea@ed.ac.uk.

 

We look forward to seeing you at some of our sessions!
