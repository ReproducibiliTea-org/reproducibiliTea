Hello, we're Edinburgh ReproducibiliTea and we host a mix of seminar/journal club style sessions on Open Research topics every 3rd Friday of the month from 11-12 UK time during the academic semesters. 

For an overview of our schedule and blog posts about our previous sessions see https://edopenresearch.com/reproducibilitea-blog/. 

We also have a YouTube channel were we upload our recordings https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9y6VX6Dvs4-vC8eDuOKpNQ and we also post our recordings and other relevant materials on our OSF page: https://osf.io/kh5px/
