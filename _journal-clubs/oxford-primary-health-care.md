**About:**
Our Journal Club is open to everyone: from Open Science enthusiasts, beginners or skeptics! Together, we can learn from one another and improve how we conduct and share our research, data, methods, code, statistical analyses, and more! We cater to both qualitative and quantitative methodologists and focus on all aspects of Open Science in research.

We meet on Wednesdays at 12.30 pm for 1 hour at the Radcliffe Primary Care Building in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter (32 Woodstock Road, OX2 6HT). Our Journal Club will run each term for 8 weeks to align with the Oxford academic calendar. 

The most up to date information is on [our OSF page](https://osf.io/2qvwa/) and we will circulate meeting details via email so sign up here: [https://forms.gle/ZYTLLXko21HeVe2XA](https://forms.gle/ZYTLLXko21HeVe2XA) 

**The format:**
For each session, we expect attendees to have read the assigned paper. We (Nick DeVito & Georgia Richards) will present a short (5-15mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees. For some Journal Clubs, we will have a workshop where we present some of the available tools and have more practical discussions to help develop skills. 

Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!
