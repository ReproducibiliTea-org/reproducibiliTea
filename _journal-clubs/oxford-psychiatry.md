The Reproducibilitea journal club at Oxford Psychiatry is open to all students and staff, enthusiasts and skeptics of open science. Our group will focus primarily on open science in clinical research, and people from all backgrounds and disciplines are welcome to join.

We are in the process of finalising the dates, times and topics of our meetings, so if you want to join the organising committee please feel free to get in touch.
