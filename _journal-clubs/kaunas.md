Welcome to the Kaunas University of Technology chapter of ReproducibiliTea, with a special focus on the engineering and natural sciences!

In today's competitive research landscape, how can we ensure our work is not only innovative but also transparent, credible, and impactful? This journal club is a collaborative space for researchers who are curious about improving their research workflows through open science practices.

Our mission is to explore and implement practical strategies for enhancing research quality throughout the entire research lifecycle—from initial hypothesis and data management to analysis, publication, and public engagement. We aim to foster a culture of transparent, reproducible, and trustable research.
