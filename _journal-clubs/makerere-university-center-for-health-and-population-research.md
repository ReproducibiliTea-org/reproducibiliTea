The Makerere University Center for Health and Population Research Journal Club aims to build an open science community among early career scientist in Uganda. The journal club provides a platform for researchers to discuss issues around reproducibility, ethics, and transparency in research.

The club meets twice a month to read and share papers and materials related to open science. Through facilitated discussions and working groups, members are introduced to concepts and best practices in areas like open data, preregistration, and replication.

The journal club welcomes students from all disciplines related to public health, healthcare policy, research, and informatics. By creating a collaborative environment, the club empowers young and mid-career scientists to conduct research that is transparent, reproducible, and ethical. This aligns with the club's overall goal of reducing wastage in research through promoting the utilization of high-quality generated evidence from early career scientists.
