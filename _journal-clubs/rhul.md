The RHUL branch of RTea is based at the Department of Psychology at Royal Holloway University of London. Our RTea journal club meets once a month (date and time TBA).

The format of our meetings varies depending on the topic at hand, ranging from how-to talks on new methodological and statistical tools to paper discussions.

We particularly encourage input from PhD students and early career researchers, but all are welcome. Anyone can propose a possible topic/paper and present/lead a discussion, so please do get involved!
