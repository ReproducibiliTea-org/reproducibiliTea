The AffectiveScience@Iscte journal club focuses on best research practices in psychological science, with a particular interest in affective and social research, including affective computing.
Our aim is to promote scientific literacy, critical thinking, and hands‑on skills in reproducible research by discussing articles and engaging in activities related to ethical and robust research practices.
Our monthly meetings welcome students and researchers interested in affective and social psychology, fostering collaborative and interdisciplinary exchange.
