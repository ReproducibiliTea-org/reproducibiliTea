The ReproducibiliTea Vienna was founded by the Early Career Researchers of the Faculty of Psychology. It is meeting once a month in order to discuss papers on open science and exchange our own open science research practices. ReproducibiliTEA Vienna is open to researchers from all areas and from all stages of research (early career to senior academics).
