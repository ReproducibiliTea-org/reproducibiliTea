we hold monthly Open Science Workshops during term time. 

Each workshop consists of several sessions (e.g. a guest speaker, a volunteer-led journal reading session and a peer learning/bring your questions session) framed around a different overarching theme each time. 

All sessions are focused on areas of specific interest to MSc and PhD students.
