The journal club was set up in September 2019 for early career researchers in the vision and language research group of the University of Leicester, but everyone is welcome!  We get together (with tea, coffee and cake!) to discuss interesting journal articles and discuss topics like open science, replicability in research, pre-registration and data sharing, among others. 

We meet every other Tuesday from 11am - 12pm in the George Davies Centre. Meeting details are circulated every week via email so if you are interested email me ([slt47@le.ac.uk](mailto:slt47@le.ac.uk)) and I will add you to the mailing list.
