Inspired by the ReproducibiliTea journal club CommuniTea the Babraham institute ReproducibiliTea journal club is a new journal club format. Our aims are to develop skills at creating figures that are both reproducible and more effective visual communications of data and results, whilst also providing constructive feedback to authors. To this end, we are looking for authors of recent pre-prints or papers who would like to volunteer their work for us to cover. The format is designed to not take up too much of your time, meeting once every 2 weeks and covering 1 paper every 4; with the first session focused on reproducibility and the second on figure design. Participants will split up into groups which will each focus on one figure.

We aim to embody open-science values by publishing our constructive critiques of the papers that we cover here on this blog, using open tooling as a collaborative project for which all our contributors shall receive credit.

See the format page for details of our journal club format.
