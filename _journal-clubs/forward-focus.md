Forward Focus is a monthly, virtual journal club for voice enthusiasts (SLPs, ENTs, vocologists, students, etc.) to connect and discuss current findings in voice research.

Forward Focus was started by a collective of SLPs and SLP students seeking to bridge the gap between current voice research findings and clinical service provision. Our meetings are virtual to create opportunities for individuals from different regions to join and connect with each other. We strive to create a welcoming environment through open, judgement-free conversations where individuals of all experience levels can learn and share their perspectives.

Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions, or if you are interested in joining our community member list! We hope to see you at our next meeting!
