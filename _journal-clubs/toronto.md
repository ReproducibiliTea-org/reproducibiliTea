Welcome to the Toronto ReproducibiliTea Club, hosted at York University! The goal of the club is to have an open space for productive discussions of papers and topics related to reproducibility. No matter what university, discipline, or level of study you are at, we invite you to join us!

Club meetings will take place online via Zoom every 2 weeks. The meetings will be open-discussion based. Reading the papers is encouraged, but optional. We look forward to having you join us!
