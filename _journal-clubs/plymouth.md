ReproducibiliTea Plymouth welcomes staff and students at all career stages. We meet fortnightly (in-person, as of late 2021) to discuss papers about open and transparent science, research methods, research culture, and science reform. Our papers mostly focus on issues in Psychology and Cognitive Science, but we also welcome researchers from other disciplines.

If you'd like to join our mailing list, please contact our lead organizer Rory Spanton at rory.spanton@plymouth.ac.uk
