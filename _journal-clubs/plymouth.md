Our ReproducibiliTea Journal Club welcomes both staff and students. 
Our aim is to create a safe space, where we can discuss how should we do 
Open Science, how should we think about Transparent Science, and a bit of 
philosophy of Open Science. For each session, we select a target paper to read
and discuss. 

We maintain a webpage where we have links to papers, dates and places, journal club entries, and follow-up materials: [Plymouth ReproducibiliTea](https://lenarddome.github.io/reproducibilitea/)
