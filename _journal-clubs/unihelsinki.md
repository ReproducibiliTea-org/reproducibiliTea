We are ReproducibiliTea UniHelsinki team based at the University of Helsinki. Our interests lay in the biological and medical aspects of science reproducibility. However, we hope to expand to other fields of science, too. 

Our club welcomes researchers from all career stages. At our meetings, we encourage open discourse and try to create a comfortable atmosphere for everyone to speak up and express their opinions.
