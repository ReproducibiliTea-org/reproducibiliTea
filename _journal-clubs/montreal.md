Our initiative is driven by the belief that advancing scientific knowledge requires transparency, collaboration, and open access to research.  At the Montreal ReproducibiliTea Journal Club, we believe that science is at its best when it's accessible to everyone. That's why we're excited to announce that we are open to queries and questions from the general public!

Transparency and accessibility are core principles of open science, and we want to extend this openness beyond our academic community. Whether you're a fellow scientist, a curious individual, or someone passionate about neuroscience, your questions and inquiries are welcome.

If you have questions about the research, scientific methods, or the topics we discuss in our meetings, don't hesitate to reach out. You can connect with us through our dedicated channels, and our members will do their best to provide answers and insights.

By engaging with the public, we aim to demystify neuroscience and open up a dialogue that promotes a better understanding of the brain and its mysteries. We firmly believe that collective knowledge and shared curiosity are powerful drivers of scientific progress.

So, whether you're a seasoned researcher or simply someone with a curious mind, join us! Letâ€™s talk about the wonders of the brain and the principles of open science.
