**About**

ReproducibiliTea Rotterdam is a journal club organized by the Open Science Community Rotterdam ([OSCR](http://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/)). We discuss documents addressing various topics on open and responsible science practices.

**Format**

- Every session, one discussant chooses a published article, preprint, or blog post about a specific open science topic (e.g., the advantages of publishing your work in open access journals, criticism of pre-publication peer review, best practices of data/code curation/sharing, ...). The discussant prepares a short presentation (5'-15') summarizing the main points of the document, but the bulk of the meeting (45'-55') is dedicated to open discussion: Is the topic relevant for your field of research? In case of specific issues, has anybody proposed and/or implemented some solutions? Can any of these solutions be translated, scaled, and applied in other research areas?

- Even though some papers, at first glance, seem to relate only to a specific discipline (e.g., psychology has been working on open science issues quite intensively in the past years), we aim to extract general lessons that can be helpful for researchers in different fields.


**Attendees**

This journal club is open to everyone: PhD candidates, post-docs, junior and senior faculty, from any school/department at EUR and Erasmus MC. Interested Bachelor and Master students are also welcome to join, especially if it can be helpful for their thesis.
Interested parties not employed at EUR or Erasmus MC can send an email to the lead organizer with a request to join specific sessions.  

**Practical Information**

After a long hiatus, ReproducibiliTea Rotterdam is starting up again in September 2024 with monthly on campus meetings. Around two weeks before the session, an invitation is sent via the mailing list of the [Open Science Community Rotterdam](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/) (to be included, please contact the lead organizer). Announcements are also made on our website ([News](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/categories/news/) section) and on Twitter ([@OSCRotterdam](https://twitter.com/OSCRotterdam)).
