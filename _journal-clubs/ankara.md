This journal club meets twice every month and discusses selected papers on scientific rigor. An attendee takes the responsibility at each meeting that makes a short summary of the paper and leads the discussion.

Our meetings are open to all researchers and students from Baskent University and other universities located in Ankara. We welcome attendees with different backgrounds and disciplines. We assure a friendly and open environment in meetings. So, please attend for tea, snacks, open science, and friendly conversation.
