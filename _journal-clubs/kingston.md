**About**

The journal club is open to everyone across Kingston University, at any level, from any discipline or department. We meet monthly at 12: 00 - 13:30 via Zoom. We also organise talks and workshops on open research related topics. The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/4jw53/), and we will circulate meeting details through the Kingston ReproT mailing list. Please contact Dr Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe to join the mailing list.

â
**The format**

For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5 mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion among all attendees.

**Inclusivity**

Everyone is welcome to join us - sceptics and enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views from all perspectives. Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!

â**How to join**

To join the mailing list please email the club organiser, [Dr Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe](mailto:A.Gourdon@kingston.ac.uk).
