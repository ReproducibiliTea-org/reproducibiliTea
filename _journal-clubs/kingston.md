**About**

The journal club is open to everyone across Kingston University, at any level, from any discipline or department. From January 2020 we will meet monthly at 12.00 on the Penrhyn Road campus. We also organise talks and workshops on open research related topics. The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/4jw53/), and we will circulate meeting details through the Kingston ReproT mailing list. Please contact Emma Henderson to join the mailing list.

​
**The format**

For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5 mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion among all attendees.

**Inclusivity**

Everyone is welcome to join us - sceptics and enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views from all perspectives. Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!

​**How to join**

To join the mailing list please email the club organiser, [Emma Henderson](mailto:E.Henderson@kingston.ac.uk).
