**About**

The journal club is open to everyone across Kingston University, at any level, from any discipline or department. The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/4jw53/), and we will circulate meeting details through the Kingston ReproT mailing list. 


**The format**

For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5 mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion among all attendees.

**Inclusivity**

Everyone is welcome to join us - sceptics and enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views from all perspectives. Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!

**How to join**

To join the mailing list please email the club organiser.
