  This ReproducibiliTea is associated with the Mannheim Open Science Meetup, bringing together open science enthusiasts across various institutions in Mannheim. Find us on Twitter @MAOpenScience
  
  As our community consists of various disciplines, the ReproducibiliTea Mannheim wants to cover open science topics of broader interest. Meetings will be held monthly. Being “born” during the pandemic, we don’t have a real life meeting location (yet!).
  
  Our first (online) meeting will take place on December 8th 2020, 17:00 GMT +1. E-mail us for the link!
