This ReproducibiliTea is associated with the Mannheim Open Science Meetup, bringing together open science enthusiasts across various institutions in Mannheim. Find us on Twitter @MAOpenScience

As our community consists of various disciplines, the ReproducibiliTea Mannheim wants to cover open science topics of broader interest. Meetings will be held monthly. Being "born" during the pandemic, we don't have a real life meeting location (yet!).

Our next meeting will take place on March 9th 2021, 17:30 (timezone: Berlin), where we will discuss

Schneider, J., Ye, D., Hill, A.M., & Whitehorn, A.S. (2020). Continued post-retraction citation of a fraudulent clinical trial report, 11 years after it was retracted for falsifying data. Scientometrics 125 (2877–2913)
