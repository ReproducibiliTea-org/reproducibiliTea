This ReproducibiliTea is associated with the Mannheim Open Science Meetup, bringing together open science enthusiasts across various institutions in Mannheim. Find us on Twitter @MAOpenScience

As our community consists of various disciplines, the ReproducibiliTea Mannheim wants to cover open science topics of broader interest. Meetings will be held monthly. Being "born" during the pandemic, we don't have a real life meeting location (yet!).

Our next meeting will take place on October 12th 2022, 17:30 (timezone: Berlin), where we will discuss

Berberi, I., Roche, D.G. No evidence that mandatory open data policies increase error correction. Nat Ecol Evol (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-022-01879-9
