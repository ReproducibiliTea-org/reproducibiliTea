The ReproducibiliTea Groningen aims to 
1. increase awareness, knowledge and skills for open and reproducible science;
2. build an open science community, to help, learn from and support each other in our open science endeavors;
3. assist in making regular (small) steps towards open & reproducible science. 

The idea is to have regular meetings on any reproducibility related topic, from discussing bias in the literature, a work-session on preprints/preregistrations or a workshop on r-markdown/Github. 
What the contents will be exactly is to be decided by us all and will change from meeting to meeting. We aim to be a journal club plus, in that we try to focus on practical use; hence workshops make up quite a bit of the sessions.
Furthermore we're closely related to the [Open Science Community Groningen](https://openscience-groningen.nl/oscg/), which also hosts some of our collaboratively written [blogposts on open science](https://openscience-groningen.nl/category/blogs/)

We meet every two weeks, meeting times switch every week between 10.00 - 11.00 am. and 14.00 - 15.00 pm., hopefully enabling more people to join. 
Everyone is welcome, from any discipline and backgrounds, open-science minded or not at all. Swing by, drop in, have a cookie, and enjoy the ride!
