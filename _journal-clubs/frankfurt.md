# The ReproducibiliTea journal club in Frankfurt

Our journal club is organized by the Frankfurt Open Science Initiative, located within the Goethe University, and is open to anyone who is interested in the topic. 

Every second Wednesday, we are going to meet online on Zoom, from 4pm to 5pm. All relevant materials as well as the latest schedule can be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/254t7/).  

In case you are interested in Open Science in general and want to be more involved, you can [sign up here](https://dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de/mailman/listinfo/openscience) to our mailing list of the Frankfurt Open Science Initiative.

We are looking forward to welcoming you! :)
