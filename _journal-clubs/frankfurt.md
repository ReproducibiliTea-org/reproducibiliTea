# The ReproducibiliTea journal club in Frankfurt

Our journal club is organized by the Frankfurt Open Science Initiative, located within the Goethe University, and is open to anyone who is interested in the topic. 

Every second Monday, starting from 14th of October 2019 onwards, we are going to meet in room 5.G202 in the PEG building, from 2pm to 3pm. Afterwards until 4pm, we are going to host an Open Science Caf√©, where discussions can continue to flourish and general questions about Open Science can be asked (e.g., where and how can I upload my data?). All relevant materials as well as the latest schedule can be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/254t7/).  

In case you are interested in Open Science in general and want to be more involved, you can [sign up here](https://dlist.server.uni-frankfurt.de/mailman/listinfo/openscience) to our mailing list of the Frankfurt Open Science Initiative.

We are looking forward to welcoming you! :)
