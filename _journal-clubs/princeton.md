For each session, we will have one or two facilitator's lead discussion on the week's reading. Periodically we will be joined by a guest from the Princeton faculty or a visiting scholar. 

Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike!
We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views views from all perspectives.
Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!
