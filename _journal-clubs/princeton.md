Princeton-Rutgers ReproducibiliTea is organized by Meghan Testerman (Princeton), Jessica Kosie (Princeton), and Jason Geller (Rutgers) and is sponsored by the Princeton University Library.

The journal club is open to everyone across Princeton University and Rugers University, from any discipline or department.

We meet virtually through Zoom on Wednesdays from 3:00-4:00 p.m. (see the schedule for exact dates)  

Full schedule and readings can be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/af4td/).
You can also find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Princeton_Tea)

For each session, a volunteer host from the group or a guest from the community will lead a discussion on the week's reading.  

Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike!

We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views from all perspectives.
Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!
