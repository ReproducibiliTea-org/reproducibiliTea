Welcome to the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health and Health Systems ReproducibiliTea journal club! This journal club is open to anyone within the School at any level.

We are a relatively new journal club, with our first meeting held in January 2021. We hold meetings every two weeks, and very much looking forward to discussing how to improve scientific practice, and making science more reproducible, open, and accessible.
