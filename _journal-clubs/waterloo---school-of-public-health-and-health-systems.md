Welcome to the University of Waterloo's School of Public Health and Health Systems ReproducibiliTea journal club! This journal club is open to anyone within the School at any level.

We are a new journal club, with our first meeting to be held in January 2021. We are very much looking forward to discussing how to improve scientific practice, and making science more reproducible, open, and accessible.
