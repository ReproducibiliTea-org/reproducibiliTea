We are an interdisciplinary journal club that meets monthly (on the last Thursday of each month at 4pm). We chat about all things meta-research, philosophy of science, and research methods, as well as topics related to improving science, including reproducibility and open science. Our journal club is open to all (so long as you are happy to endure the horrible Australian time zone differences!).
