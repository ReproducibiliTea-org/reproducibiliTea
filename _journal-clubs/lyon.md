The Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (LNRC) student club is organized by a few PhD students of the center, with no specific leader (here we rolled a dice to choose the JC communication 'lead'). Student club sessions are
organized on a monthly basis. They consist in a presentation of a paper, principle, software, method, etc somehow related to neuroscience which is then discussed in the way of locally trying to 'fix science'. 
We seek to be very careful regarding the idea that any comments have to be welcomed and discussed regardless of the scientific statute at play. By 'student club', we do not mean that we exclude extra-student staff. 
They are all welcome, but we seek to stick to the bottom-up fashion of discussing, proposing, etc. In practice, our student club is also a chill-out time during which we drink tea and eat cakes.
