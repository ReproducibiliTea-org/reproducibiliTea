We are aiming to create a welcoming space at Queen's where researchers from all fields, and from any career stage, can relax and discuss reproducible practices and open science. Anyone with an interest is more than welcome to apply.

The first meetings will potentially be online, but we have also secured a physical address at QUB's beautiful Graduate School. Hope to see you there!
