QUB ReproducibiliTea is a welcoming space at Queenâ€™s where researchers from all fields, and from any career stage, can relax and discuss reproducible practices and open science/scholarship.

We are meeting in-person about every 3 weeks, typically at The Graduate School. Check our OSF repository or join our Teams channel for more information!
