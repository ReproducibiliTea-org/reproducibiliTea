We are based in Montreal, Canada. This journal club was initiated by the undergraduate subcommittee of the Tannebaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) of the Montreal Neurological Hospital (The Neuro), hence the name of this club. We aim to target McGill undergraduate students, to educate open science in research and hope to engage students in research early on in their academic journey. 

Our club meetings will be hosted monthly, in the last week of the month from September to November and January to March each school year. They will be IN PERSON, lead by a professor, researcher or graduate student who actively incorporates open science practices in their research. We will provide snacks and tea!

We look forward to seeing you at our meetings:)
