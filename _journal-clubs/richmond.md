**About:**
The Data Science Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) proudly hosts the ReproducibiliTea journal club. All VCU students, faculty, and staff regardless of discipline or department are welcome to join us. Similarly, attendees from Virginia Union University, University of Richmond, and wider open science community also are welcome.

The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/g56qp/wiki/home). To stay up to date with all VCU DSL open science initiatives and events, we encourage joining both the DSL general listserv as well as the VCU RTea mailing list. 

**The format:**
RTea meetings are informal, and everyone is welcome to attend. Each month we will focus on a specific theme (e.g., data sharing and management, project organization, analysis methods). A discussion leader for that meeting will select one or two papers that highlight or illustrate important topics associated with the theme of the month. Meetings typically begin with the discussion leader providing a short (5-15 min) overview of the theme and article(s), with the remaining time dedicated to open discussion among all attendees over tea and snacks. The most up-to-date information about the discussion leaders, monthly themes, and selected articles can be found on [our OSF page](https://osf.io/g56qp/wiki/home).

**Inclusivity:**
Everyone benefits from inclusivity and diversity. Your voice is welcome here--open science skeptics and enthusiasts alike! No matter your career stage, discipline, familiarity with open science, or university affiliation, you are welcome.

**Get all the latest updates:**   
Join our mailing list by sending an email to listserv@lists.vcu.edu. Include a *single* line of text in the body of the message saying âSUBSCRIBE RTEA-L <your name>â (No need to include the quotes in your email).
