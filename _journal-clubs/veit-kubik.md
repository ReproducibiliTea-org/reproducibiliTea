With the “Bielefeld University Reproducible Science Tea” (BURST) group, we would like to contribute to making the process and results of scientific work more transparent and accessible. Topics that concern us include free access to publications, analysis code, data and hypotheses. Open and reproducible research is not meant to be a new niche or alternative to traditional research, but the implementation of what most of us intuitively consider to be standard research ( “Open science is just science done right” ).

The BURST-group is scheduled to meet on the first Friday of each month, and will discuss articles on the topics of open and reproducible science, as well as new developments and ideas arising in our disciplines.

Our meetings are open to both students and scientific staff in psychology and in neighbouring fields. Everyone is invited to suggest topics and articles for discussion and to participate in the organisation of the meetings.

A lot of great information on open and reproducible science can be found on the internet, and we will make extensive use of these resources. Founding a group at Bielefeld University and offering local meetings (at the university or via Zoom) is meant to facilitate a more interactive exchange among us, and to provide us all with the opportunity to bring forward our individual questions and ideas, so that we can all shape the direction the group will take in the future.

Therefore, we are looking forward to your participation and your contributions.

See you soon!
