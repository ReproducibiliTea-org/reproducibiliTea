Hi, weâ€™re Hazel and Connor, PhD students in the Music Department at Durham University (UK) and the organisers of the Durham ReproducibiliTea Journal Club. 

During our journal club, we hope to facilitate discussions about the issues and experiences surrounding Open Research practices from the sciences to the arts. 

We will cover a range of Open Research topics relevant to the replication crisis and research improvements, from ontology and methodology to publication and authorship.
