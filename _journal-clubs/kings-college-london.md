We are an interdisciplinary journal club at King's College London based at the Denmark Hill campus. If you are looking for an opportunity to broaden your knowledge of open science, share experiences, and get to know others at King's interested in open science, please come along! No prerequisites are required. We welcome people at all career stages, from undergraduate students to permanent staff members.

Each meeting is focused around one paper or article that we have chosen to discuss, which we use as a starting point to talk broadly about open science, meta-research, theory development, research methods, and other topics around improving science. Meetings are on the second Thursday of each month from 4-5pm in the IoPPN main building (seminar room 9 until September 2024), with the option to join online.
