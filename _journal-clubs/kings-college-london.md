We are an interdisciplinary journal club at King's College London based at the Denmark Hill campus. If you are looking for an opportunity to broaden your knowledge of open science, share experiences, and get to know others at King's interested in open science, please come along! There are no prerequisites, we welcome anyone who is interested in joining.

Each meeting is focused around one article, which we use as a starting point to talk broadly about open science, metaresearch, theory development, research methods, and other topics around improving science. 

Meetings are typically on the second Thursday of each month from 4-5pm in the IoPPN main building, with the option to join online.
