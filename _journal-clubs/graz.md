The ReproducibiliTea in Graz, Austria is organized by the PhD students Gabriela Hofer (Differential Psychology) and Hilmar Brohmer (Social Psychology) and is greatly supported by the Graz Open Science Initiative ([@GrazOpenScience](https://twitter.com/GrazOpenScience)). 
 
We are slowly evolving from a journal club of psychology papers to a multidisciplinary discussion group. 
 
Moreover, our increasing number of attendees demonstrates an interest in Open Science-related topics throughout academic disciplines: In the spring / summer semester 2019 we counted usually 5 to 7 members per session. In fall / winter semester 2019/20 we are in the double digits (so far).
 
If you are interested to join our ReproducibiliTea please [get in touch](mailto:graz_open_science@zoho.com) and come along!
