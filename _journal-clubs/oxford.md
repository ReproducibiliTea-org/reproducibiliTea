The original reproducibiliTea Journal Club, meeting weekly during term-time at the University of Oxford. Most members come from the Department of Experimental Psychology, but we welcome people from all over the university, and have had regular members in the past from Anthropology and non-psychology parts of the Medical Sciences Division.

The majority of our regular members are graduate students and early career researchers, but we're pleased to count one or two established faculty as regular members, too.
