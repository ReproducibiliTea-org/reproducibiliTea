ReproducibiliTea journal clubs help early career researchers build a local community of ECRs interested in open and reproducible research. It can be very isolating to be one of the few within a research group, or department, that are actively engaged or interested in improving research practices. ReproducibiliTea helps researchers who want to change this.


We are ReproducibiliTea.

We all know how horrible it can be to jump through annoying administrative hurdles or dodge financial barriers to ultimately try to make a positive change. Setting up a ReproducibiliTea Journal Club is easy, free and does not need any admin approval. In a ReproducibiliTea Journal Club, papers are selected that are broadly relevant to the replication crisis and scientific improvements. The journal club is advertised around the department or university, raising awareness of reproducibility and Open Science in the process. The chosen papers are then discussed during regular journal club meetings, often over cups of tea, lunch or snacks. 

The ReproducibiliTea Journal Club has proven to be a success in Oxford, where it was founded in spring 2018 by Sophia Crüwell, Amy Orben, and Sam Parsons (then Masters student, PhD student, and early postdoc respectively). Since then, it has received widespread international recognition. There are now {{ site.journal-clubs.size | minus: 1}} other ReproducibiliTea Journal Clubs, with more joining at an increasingly faster rate.
