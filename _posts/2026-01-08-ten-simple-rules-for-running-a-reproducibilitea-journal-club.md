The idea of ReproducibiliTea is simple: Get a group of aspiring early career researchers together, drink tea, and critically discuss issues surrounding reproducibility, open research, and academic culture. But how do you even get started? How do you engage people? How do you balance logistics and inspiration?
<br><br>
In our paper, we as past and present members of the ReproducibiliTea Global Steering Committee have drawn on our experience and that of our wider network to offer you 10 simple rules for organising a ReproducibiliTea journal club. Our aim is to equip you as early career researchers with the tools needed to lead grassroots change in research culture. Whether you are launching your first meeting or sustaining a long-running journal club, these rules are designed to help you brew a welcoming, impactful, and inspired community – one cup of tea at a time.
