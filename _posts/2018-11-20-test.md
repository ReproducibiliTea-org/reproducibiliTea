In January 2025 [we welcomed 4 new members](https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2025/01/10/reproducibiliteain2025) into the ReproducibiliTea steering committee. It was an exciting time filled with getting to know each other and making plans that we have been implementing over the past months.
In this blog post, we would like to update you on our progress and outline our projects.

Currently, the ReproducibiliTea steering committee consists of 7 members: 
Helena Gellersen (co-chair), Abigail Licata, Paulina Manduch (co-chair), Anastasiia Marmyleva, Michael Muhoozi, Hemani Sharma, and Lianne Wolsink.

We run the following projects and organisational functions:
