In January 2025 [we welcomed 4 new members](https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2025/01/10/reproducibiliteain2025) into the ReproducibiliTea steering committee. It was an exciting time filled with getting to know each other and making plans that we have been implementing over the past months.
In this blog post, we would like to update you on our progress and outline our projects.

Currently, the ReproducibiliTea steering committee consists of 7 members: 
Helena Gellersen (co-chair), Abigail Licata, Paulina Manduch (co-chair), Anastasiia Marmyleva, Michael Muhoozi, Hemani Sharma, and Lianne Wolsink.

We are supported by the ReproducibiliTea advisory board (Sophia Crüwell, Matt Jaquiery, William Ngiam, Amy Orben, Sam Parsons, Jade Pickering, Hazel Aileen van der Walle, Jan Vornhagen) as well as other team members and contributors.
<br><br>

We run the following projects and organisational functions:

**Website and OSF folder** - Team: Paulina Manduch, Lianne Wolsink, Abigail Licata, Matt Jaquiery, Michael Muhoozi, Helena Gellersen

We develop, add and update content on our [website](https://reproducibilitea.org/) and [OSF folder](https://osf.io/3qrj6/), for example:
our [list of resources](https://reproducibilitea.org/resources), which includes resources published by ReproducibiliTea journal clubs: video recordings of past events, presentations, reading lists, blogs, as well as resources published by other organisations, lists of books, podcasts, games, and more;
our [sharing stories section](https://reproducibilitea.org/sharing-stories), which includes case studies, blog posts, etc. by ReproducibiliTea organisers; 
our [about section](https://reproducibilitea.org/about/) with a list of journal articles featuring the ReproducibiliTea initiative.
<br><br>

**Reading lists** - Team: Lianne Wolsink (lead), Hazel Aileen van der Walle, Hemani Sharma, Helena Gellersen 

There are two new reading lists available via [our app](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/) and [OSF folder](https://osf.io/3ed8x/files/): 
* Open Research…in the Arts?
* Black in Neuro - reading list on diversity and inclusivity 

We are also working on new reading lists (e.g., researcher’s degrees of freedom, post-publication reviewing, bioinformatics).
We are also very open to contributions. If you are interested in creating a new reading list, please contact us via email reproducibilitea@gmail.com 
See our [guide on how to create a ReproducibiliTea reading list](https://osf.io/8w64c). 

In June 2025, we were awarded a [SIPS Commendation](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/) for our reading lists!
