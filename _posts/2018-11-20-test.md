In January 2025 [we welcomed 4 new members](https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2025/01/10/reproducibiliteain2025) into the ReproducibiliTea steering committee. It was an exciting time filled with getting to know each other and making plans that we have been implementing over the past months.
In this blog post, we would like to update you on our progress and outline our projects.

Currently, the ReproducibiliTea steering committee consists of 7 members: 
Helena Gellersen (co-chair), Abigail Licata, Paulina Manduch (co-chair), Anastasiia Marmyleva, Michael Muhoozi, Hemani Sharma, and Lianne Wolsink.

We are supported by the ReproducibiliTea advisory board (Sophia Crüwell, Matt Jaquiery, William Ngiam, Amy Orben, Sam Parsons, Jade Pickering, Hazel Aileen van der Walle, Jan Vornhagen) as well as other team members and contributors.
<br><br>

We run the following projects and organisational functions:

**Website and OSF folder** - Team: Paulina Manduch, Lianne Wolsink, Abigail Licata, Matt Jaquiery, Michael Muhoozi, Helena Gellersen

We develop, add and update content on our [website](https://reproducibilitea.org/) and [OSF folder](https://osf.io/3qrj6/), for example:
our [list of resources](https://reproducibilitea.org/resources), which includes resources published by ReproducibiliTea journal clubs: video recordings of past events, presentations, reading lists, blogs, as well as resources published by other organisations, lists of books, podcasts, games, and more;
our [sharing stories section](https://reproducibilitea.org/sharing-stories), which includes case studies, blog posts, etc. by ReproducibiliTea organisers; 
our [about section](https://reproducibilitea.org/about/) with a list of journal articles featuring the ReproducibiliTea initiative.
<br><br>

**Reading lists** - Team: Lianne Wolsink (lead), Hazel Aileen van der Walle, Hemani Sharma, Helena Gellersen 

There are two new reading lists available via [our app](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/) and [OSF folder](https://osf.io/3ed8x/files/): 
* Open Research…in the Arts?
* Black in Neuro - reading list on diversity and inclusivity 

We are also working on new reading lists (e.g., researcher’s degrees of freedom, post-publication reviewing, bioinformatics).
We are also very open to contributions. If you are interested in creating a new reading list, please contact us via email reproducibilitea@gmail.com 
See our [guide on how to create a ReproducibiliTea reading list](https://osf.io/8w64c). 

In June 2025, we were awarded a [SIPS Commendation](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/) for our reading lists!

**Events** - Team: Abigail Licata, Paulina Manduch

We organise drop-in sessions and networking events, which provide a platform for meeting other organisers, exchanging ideas, and asking questions related to ReproducibiliTea journal club organization.
<br><br> 


**Internal communications and collaborations** 

Our team keeps the community updated via Slack and mailing lists, but recently we have worked to strengthen the collaborations between ReproducibiliTea clubs via three avenues:
* The Speaker Swap program 
* We encourage collaborations via ReproducibiliTea Collaborations 
* We have introduced the idea of [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](https://reproducibilitea.org/special-interest-groups)
<br><br>


**Post-publication review project** - Team: Paulina Manduch, Lianne Wolsink 

This project is aimed at encouraging journal clubs to engage in post-publication reviewing and commenting (see [our blog post](https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2025/11/07/post-publication-reviewing) & [a new section on our website](https://reproducibilitea.org/post-publication-reviews)).

In October 2025, we organised two webinars on the topic of peer review and its diversification (see [full programme](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuFoCPYjMzKZ2kpBVBgXHVTPXl8stghAA9e6sVWdaEA/edit?tab=t.0 )). The video recordings are available on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71JDbaBfy83TrUALV3sNQmlMblllftF7).

In our recent blog post series, ReproducibiliTea organisers have shared their insights and experiences with post-publication reviewing [blog post 1](https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2025/11/17/post-publication-reviewing-kings) |

**Paper with tips for running a ReproducibiliTea journal club** - Team: Lianne Wolsink, Abigail Licata, Paulina Manduch, Sophia Crüwell, Anastasiia Marmyleva, Hemani Sharma, Michael Muhoozi, William Ngiam, Helena Gellersen, Matt Jaquiery, Jan Vornhagen, Hazel Aileen van der Walle
 
We are finalising a manuscript focused on tips for running a ReproducibiliTea journal club, which will act as a guide for both the set-up and transferral of journal clubs as members leave their institution. 
<br><br>


**Outreach and external relations** - Team: Helena Gellersen, Hazel Aileen van der Walle, Paulina Manduch, Lianne Wolsink

In collaboration with the Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) we worked on a paper on citational politics in academia. We reflect on current biases and their causes and provide readers with a toolkit to empower them to assess their own citation practices. This work is integrated with FORRT’s Academic Wheel of Privilege (AWoP), a concerted effort to make academia more open to people from all backgrounds.

In June 2025, Hazel Aileen van der Walle gave a presentation on ReproducibiliTea and our current projects at [the UKRN Local Network Leads retreat](https://www.ukrn.org/2025/06/10/2025-ukrn-local-network-leads-retreat-london-school-of-economics/) in London. 
<br><br>


**Final remarks**

At the end of 2025, we will have two members, Helena Gellersen and Paulina Manduch, step down from the steering committee to join the advisory board. 

We are now forming a new steering committee for 2026. We are grateful for [all the steering committee applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-SedK1vhQK9aOkeFo0zT7Vju2otMZQeXDlDrwUthFY/) sent to us!
