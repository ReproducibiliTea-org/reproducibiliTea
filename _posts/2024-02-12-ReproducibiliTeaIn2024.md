The [ReproducibiliTea Steering Community]({% post_url 2021-01-28-A-new-year,-a-new-ReproducibiliTea-Steering-Committee %}) is expanding and changing yet again to make sure that we keep the early career researcher (ECR) perspective to building open science communities as well as allowing for more diverse perspectives. This year, we are welcoming two new committee members who will bring fresh impulses to our work while saying thank you and goodbye to our fantastic former committee chair Jan Vornhagen.

So without further ado,

**Please join us in welcoming our new committee members:**
