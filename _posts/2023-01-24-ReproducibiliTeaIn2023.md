In late 2020, we decided to expand the [ReproducibiliTea Steering Community]({% post_url 2021-01-28-A-new-year,-a-new-ReproducibiliTea-Steering-Committee %}) in order to make sure, we keep the early career researcher (ECR) perspective to building open science communities as well as allowing for more diverse perspectives.
Consequently last year we started a new call for applications to again bring fresh impulses to our work.

So without further ado:

**Please join us in welcoming our new committee members:**

Helena Gellersen

Helena received her PhD in psychology from the University of Cambridge where she was also a co-organiser of the ReproducibiliTea journal club. She is now a postdoc at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.

# The coming year

We have a lot of exciting things planned for next year.
* There will be a new season of the [ReproducibiliTea Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/reproducibilitea)
* We will expand our offer of [Reading Lists](https://rpt-rl.netlify.app/)
* and we are looking to rework our community outreach.

Like last year, we will also reflect on our recruiting process. We will add that soon.
In the mean time, we are always looking for ideas. If you yourself want to get involved, have a cool idea you think we could tackle, or have some critic for us, please [get in touch](mailto: ReproducibilITea@gmail.com)

In conclusion: A new year, a new steering committee and a lot of things to do.
We are looking forward to it.
