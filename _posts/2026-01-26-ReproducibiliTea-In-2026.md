The ReproducibiliTea Steering Community is expanding and changing yet again to make sure that we keep the early career researcher (ECR) perspective to building open research communities as well as allowing for more diverse perspectives. This year, we are welcoming 4 new committee members who will bring fresh impulses to our work.

<br/>

**Please join us in welcoming our new committee members:**

Ze Freeman [@zefreeman.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/zefreeman.bsky.social)

Ze is finishing his PhD at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London. In 2024, he started the university’s ReproducibiliTea club, which he co-organises. He has collaborated on open research projects at King’s, in the UKRN, and with other groups to improve transparency and credibility in research.

Marjan Monshi

Marjan is a PhD candidate in Physics at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), in collaboration with the European PCAM network at Southern Denmark University. She is one of the core members of the Open Science community at KTU and registered the first university's ReproducibiliTea journal club specifically for the engineering faculty. Inspired by the shift towards democratic and reproducible research, she values trust and transparency and is committed to fostering a collaborative culture of knowledge sharing among early-career researchers.

**And, our new committee chair:**

Lianne Wolsink [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liannewolsink/)

Lianne is currently finishing her PhD at the Department of Cognitive Psychology at Ruhr University Bochum (Germany). She is originally from the Netherlands, where she studied Psychology and Neuroscience in Nijmegen and Maastricht. Over the past years, she has developed a strong interest in issues surrounding reproducibility and transparency. Lianne started and co-organised the ReproducibiliTea in Bochum. She believes that ReproducibiliTea journal clubs are ideal places for early career researchers to learn, discuss, reflect, and connect, not only locally, but also with the global community and other reform initiatives.

**And, give a warm ‘welcome back’ to our returning members:**

Abigail Licata [@licataae.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/licataae.bsky.social) / [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigail-licata-456929103/)

Abigail is a PhD student in Neuroscience at the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and is a part of the Swiss Reproducibility Network. She has co-organized the ReproducibiliTea journal clubs since 2023 and has been involved with reproducibility-focused events including BrainHack and workshops on reproducible analysis with R Quarto. Prior to her PhD, she worked in clinics in the US and Germany, assisting professionals of different backgrounds with neuroimaging analysis in various patient populations. Beyond her passion for reproducible neuroimaging, she also helps connect women in neuroscience across the globe as a member and event co-organizer for the Women in Neuroscience Repository. She believes in science as a collaborative effort for the benefit of humanity and hopes to spread FAIR neuroimaging methods far and wide!
