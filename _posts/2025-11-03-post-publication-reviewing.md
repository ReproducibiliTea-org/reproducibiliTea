Our ReproducibiliTea community consists of journal clubs organised and joined mainly by early career researchers who discuss scientific articles on a regular basis, sometimes even resembling the act of post-publication reviewing. The content of these discussions is, however, typically kept private. We think that this is a missed opportunity to share ideas with the wider community, learn from each other, and contribute to the scientific discourse. At the same time, we believe that ReproducibiliTea journal clubs that focus mainly on topics related to improving research practices, could also incorporate peer review training into their programmes.
