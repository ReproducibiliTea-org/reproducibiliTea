We are extremely excited to announce that we are opening applications to join the ReproducibiliTea Steering Committee at the beginning of 2021! 
Having recently reached our 100th Journal Club, we are looking for people with commitment, energy and creativity to join our team. 
By joining the ReproducibiliTea Steering Committee you have the opportunity to shape one of the most exciting and dynamic Open Science groups over the coming years.
 
We are looking for 2-3 committee members and 1 chair. 
Both committee members and chair are appointed for a stint of two years; however they can leave their position after one year. 
More details of the application procedure and roles can be found below. 

## Application Procedure
Please send the following 3 documents (as 3 separate PDFs) to [reproducibilitea@gmail.com](mailto:reproducibilitea@gmail.com?subject=Application_) with the email subject line “Application_YOURLASTNAME” (e.g. Application_ORBEN).

1. A 1-2 page CV  
2. A 1 page cover letter (200-400 words) that notes a) which position you are applying for and b) why you think you will be a good fit for the position you are applying for. 

3. 100 words on how you think ReproducibiliTea could improve in the next 2 years 

Applications are open until January 10th 2021 (midnight GMT). 

In your cover letter, please make sure you address the “essential skills” outlined below in the [Role Outlines](#role-outlines) section. 
If you have any of the “desirable skills” please also tell us that in your cover letter.

Applications will be evaluated against the essential and desirable criteria by current Steering Committee Members. 
If the members cannot meaningfully discriminate between two applications which are equally good, the position will be decided by lottery. 
The committee members also reserve the right to ask applicants to attend a short interview if that is deemed necessary.

_Note: The current ReproducibiliTea Steering Group acknowledges that the current ReproducibiliTea leadership fails to be representative of our growing membership around the world. 
We are committed to try to ensure that we become more representative over time. 
As we currently still have a limited pool of possible Steering Group members we are not yet in a position to explicitly designate certain positions of the committee for certain groups of our membership. 
In the first application round 2020/21 we will therefore reach out directly to a wide range of ReproducibiliTea journal club organisers to encourage more diverse application, with the hope that we can take stronger action in the coming years._
