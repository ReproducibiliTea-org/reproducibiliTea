Sussex Open Science (SOS) hosts various activities over tea and biscuits including a journal club (ReproducibiliTea), methods workshops, and SOS clinic to help students apply the principles of open science to their own research. 



## Mission

* Develop a discourse on open science and discuss the main ideas and debates in open research

* Build capacity of students and researchers to integrate open science principles and methods in their research

* Foster a collaborative open research culture within and beyond the University of Sussex



## Format

SOS alternates between ReproducibiliTea journal club and workshops fortnightly. At the end of each session, we dedicate 15 minutes to "SOS Clinic" where attendees can discuss practical applications of open science to their own research, and ask any questions about methodology. 

* ReproducibiliTea journal club (monthly)

* Workshops (monthly)

* SOS Clinic (fortnightly)



The activities are open to anyone who is interested and we are happy to be contacted.
