**About**   
ReproducibiliTea at the University of Surrey is run by PGRs and ECRs from the Surrey Reproducibility Society. It forms a central part of the society's activities. The society organise meetings on a fortnightly basis with different sessions taking place every time. We organise sessions that aim to deliver workshops and demonstrations to aid the development of skills needed to implement reproducible and open science methods. We alternate these with the ReproducibiliTea journal club sessions occurring once a month. Our focus is interdisciplinary and we welcome attendees at all levels of academic careers. Anyone can become a member of the Surrey Reproducibility Society, please send us an email to be added to the mailing list and receive our fortnightly newsletter.  
  
**Resources**  
We take special care to collect a library of resources to aid independent learning of reproducible and open science methods in between society meetings. They can be found on our OSF page along with detailed notes from each society meeting.
