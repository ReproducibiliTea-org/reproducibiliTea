I"~<p>The Macquarie branch of RTea is based at Macquarie University with primary input from the Departments of Psychology and Cognitive Science. The RTea journal clubs form a key part of the Macquarie Methods and Meta-science meetings (Triple M meetings). The format for triple M meetings is a mixture of RTea journal clubs and talks.</p>

<p>Talks are welcome in a range of formats. It can be a summary of something recent in your lab that speaks to open science or a how-to talk that demonstrates a new methodological, theoretical, statistical or more general data-science approach. External speakers will be invited at various points also.</p>

<p>This is an inclusive meeting, and all are welcome. We are particularly keen to have a strong masters, PhD and early career presence at these meetings. Anyone can propose a possible topic and present, so please do come along and get involved.</p>
