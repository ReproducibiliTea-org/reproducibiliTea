I"$<p><a href="/journal-clubs/#Sheffield">Sheffield University</a> held its first ReproducibiliTea meeting in October 2019, with about 15 people attending from medicine, biology, engineering,  psychology, and other departments.
<a href="https://twitter.com/stavrhina">Stavrina Dimosthenous</a>, a PhD researcher in materials science, lead the discussion and introduced us to a psychology paper by Pashler and Harris, 2012: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612463401">Is the Replicability Crisis Overblown? Three Arguments Examined</a>.
We discussed what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">p-values</a> are, what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging">p-hacking</a> is, and how p-hacking can arise when researchers exclude data that doesnâ€™t support their hypothesis.</p>
