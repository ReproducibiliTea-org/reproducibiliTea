I"ô<p>Our journal club is open to everyone. We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds. No matter how much or little you know about open science and reproducibility, you are most welcome to join us!</p>

<p>From September 2019, we have met every second Thursday at 3.30 pm on Campus Solna for tea, cookies and interesting discussions. Each session lasts 1 h and 30 min. We communicate through slack so send me an email (<a href="mailto:robin.fondberg@ki.se">robin.fondberg@ki.se</a>), or reach out on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/RobinFondberg">@RobinFondberg</a>), if you want an invite! Our second semester will start on the 16th of January.</p>

<p>Hope to see you soon!
Robin Fondberg</p>
