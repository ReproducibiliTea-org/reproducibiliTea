I"K<p>The ReproducibiliTea in Graz, Austria is organized by the PhD students Gabriela Hofer (Differential Psychology) and Hilmar Brohmer (Social Psychology) and is greatly supported by the Graz Open Science Initiative (<a href="https://twitter.com/GrazOpenScience">@GrazOpenScience</a>).</p>

<p>We are slowly evolving from a journal club of psychology papers to a multidisciplinary discussion group.</p>

<p>Moreover, our increasing number of attendees demonstrates an interest in Open Science-related topics throughout academic disciplines: In the spring / summer semester 2019 we counted usually 5 to 7 members per session. In fall / winter semester 2019/20 we are in the double digits (so far).</p>

<p>If you are interested to join our ReproducibiliTea please <a href="mailto:graz_open_science@zoho.com">get in touch</a> and come along!</p>
