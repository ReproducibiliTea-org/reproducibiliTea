I"S<p>The ReproducibiliTea Groningen aims to</p>
<ol>
  <li>increase awareness, knowledge and skills for open and reproducible science;</li>
  <li>build an open science community, to help, learn from and support each other in our open science endeavors;</li>
  <li>assist in making regular (small) steps towards open &amp; reproducible science.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea is to have regular meetings on any reproducibility related topic, from discussing bias in the literature, a work-session on preprints/preregistrations or a workshop on r-markdown/Github. 
What the contents will be exactly is to be decided by us all and will change from meeting to meeting. We aim to be a journal club plus, in that we try to focus on practical use; hence workshops make up quite a bit of the sessions.
Furthermore weâ€™re closely related to the <a href="https://openscience-groningen.nl/oscg/">Open Science Community Groningen</a>, which also hosts some of our collaboratively written <a href="https://openscience-groningen.nl/category/blogs/">blogposts on open science</a></p>

<p>We meet every two weeks, meeting times switch every week between 10.00 - 11.00 am. and 14.00 - 15.00 pm., hopefully enabling more people to join. 
Everyone is welcome, from any discipline and backgrounds, open-science minded or not at all. Swing by, drop in, have a cookie, and enjoy the ride!</p>
