<p>Our journal club is open to both staff and students at UiO across all departments. Everyone is welcome to join us - whether you are an enthusiast, a skeptic, or a cautious explorer. We plan to kick off our journal club in spring 2021. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested to participate or contribute!</p>

<h3 id="our-mission">Our mission</h3>

<ul>
  <li>provide an informal and friendly platform for discussions about meta scientific topics</li>
  <li>help each other get familiarized with open science practices (e.g., pre-registrations, sharing data, sharing preprints, etc.)</li>
  <li>connect students and researchers from various disciplines who are interested in meta science.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="format">Format</h3>

<p>Before each meeting, we read an article on meta scientific topics, which we then discuss during the meeting. At each meeting, a different discussion leader will begin by providing a short overview of the paper and facilitate discussion throughout the meeting. Anyone can propose a possible paper or topic to present if we have not covered it already. Grab a cup of tea (coffee?) and join us! Due to the current pandemic, all sessions will be held online (Zoom) for the time being.</p>
