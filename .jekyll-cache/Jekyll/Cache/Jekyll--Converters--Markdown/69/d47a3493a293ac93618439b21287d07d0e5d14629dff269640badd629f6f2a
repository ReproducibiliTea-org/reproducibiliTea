I"T<p><strong>About:</strong>
The Data Science Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) proudly hosts the ReproducibiliTea journal club. All VCU students, faculty, and staff regardless of discipline or department are welcome to join us (attendees from Virginia Union University and University of Richmond are also welcome!).</p>

<p>Beginning in January 2020, we will meet on the second Tuesday of every month at 2pm in the Virginia Institute of Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics conference room in Biotech I (MCV campus near the Eighth Street parking deck). The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our <a href="https://osf.io/bs2k7/wiki/home">OSF page</a>. To stay up to date with all VCU DSL open science initiatives and events, we encourage joining both the DSL general listserv as well as the Open Science mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>The format:</strong>
Each month we will focus on a specific theme (e.g., flexible analysis methods, project organization). A discussion leader for that meeting will select one or two papers that highlight or illustrate important topics associated with the theme of the month. The meeting will begin with the discussion leader providing a short (5-15 min) overview of the theme and article(s). The remainder of the session will be dedicated to open discussion among all attendees over tea and snacks. The most up-to-date information about the discussion leaders, monthly themes, and selected articles can be found on <a href="https://osf.io/bs2k7/wiki/home">our OSF page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusivity:</strong>
Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views views from all perspectives. Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere.</p>
