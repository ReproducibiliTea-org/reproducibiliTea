<p>Inspired by the original <a href="/journal-clubs/#Oxford">Oxford club</a> ReproducibiliTea came to Bristol in January 2019 with the support of the UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN), which is now spreading to other universities.</p>

<p>We run an ECR-led weekly journal club open to all staff and students from any discipline.</p>

<h2 id="time--place">Time &amp; Place</h2>

<p>Every other Monday, 4-5pm, via Zoom</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>In advance of each session, one attendee chooses a paper related to the barriers and solutions to better research methods in the life sciences. During the session the attendee presents a short (~15mins) overview of the chosen paper and the remainder of the session is dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees.</p>

<h2 id="inclusivity">Inclusivity</h2>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and open science enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds.</p>
