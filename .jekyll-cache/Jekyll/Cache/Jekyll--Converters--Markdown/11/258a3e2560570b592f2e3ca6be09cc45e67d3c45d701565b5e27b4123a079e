<strong>About</strong></p>

<p>The journal club is open to everyone across Kingston University, at any level, from any discipline or department. We meet monthly on the second Wednesday of the month at 12:00 - 13:30 via Zoom. We also organise talks and workshops on open research related topics. The most up-to-date information can generally be found on our <a href="https://osf.io/4jw53/">OSF page</a>, and we will circulate meeting details through the Kingston ReproT mailing list. Please contact Dr Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe to join the mailing list.</p>

<strong>The format</strong></p>

<p>For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5 mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion among all attendees.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong></p>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join us - sceptics and enthusiasts alike! We are hoping for a diverse range of attendees from all career stages, disciplines, and backgrounds, and particularly enjoy hearing views from all perspectives. Your voice is welcome here, and we offer a friendly atmosphere!</p>
