I" <p>ReproducibiliTea was originally started in 2018 by Amy Orben, Sam Parsons, and Sophia CrÃ¼well at the University of Oxford as a podcast and journal club. It is now about 18 months old and has started to find its feet; ReproducibiliTea has expanded to 42 journal clubs in 15 countries worldwide at the time of writing.
