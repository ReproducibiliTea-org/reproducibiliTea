I"q<p>Emily Williams and Kelly Lloyd have written <a href="https://leedsunilibrary.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/reproducibilitea-at-leeds/">a blog post</a> covering the first two <a href="/journal-clubs/#Leeds">ReproducibiliTea sessions at Leeds University</a>. They welcomed attendees from a wide range of disciplines from Dentistry to Data Science, and covered Marcus Munafò’s <em>Manifesto for Reproducible Science</em> and Sebastian Karcher and Diana Kapiszewski’s paper on <em>Openness in Practice in Qualitative Research</em>. To add an additional flourish, the latter meeting included a Skype call with the authors!</p>
