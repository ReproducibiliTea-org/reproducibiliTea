I"³<p><strong>About</strong></p>

<p>The ReproducibiliTea journal club is a member initiative of the <em>Open Science Community Leiden (OSCL)</em>. We discuss papers related to open science, replication, and of course reproducibility. Our journal club is open to anyone affiliated with Leiden University, no matter their background, discipline, or career status.</p>

<p>Anyone whoâ€™s never heard the term <em>open science</em> before is particularly welcome! No sign-up needed - just <strong>join OSCL Teams channel</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss methodological issues in the social sciences and beyond, and potential ways forward</li>
  <li>Familiarize ourselves with open science tools and methods</li>
  <li>Connect engaged students and researchers from various specializations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Format</strong></p>

<p>During each session, one member volunteers to host. That member will prepare a short introduction to the paper/preprint/blog post and facilitate discussion. Do we at all agree with the authorâ€™s claims? How do we integrate the findings into our own research? How can we broaden this topic to include all research fields of our members?</p>

<p>We want to stimulate open, critical conversations, and <em>encourage</em> but donâ€™t expect participants to read the paper beforehand. Of course, everyone is free to contribute as much time, effort, or input as they wish.</p>

<p><strong>Practical information</strong></p>

<p>Our monthly-ish sessions are currently hosted online, at the Open Science Community MS Teams channel. If youâ€™re not sure how to find it, or have any questions, shoot us an <a href="mailto:Leiden.Tea@gmail.com"><strong>email</strong></a>.
