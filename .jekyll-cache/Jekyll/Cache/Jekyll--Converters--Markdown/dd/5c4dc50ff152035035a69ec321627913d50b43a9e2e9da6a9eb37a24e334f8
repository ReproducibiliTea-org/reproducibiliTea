I"’<p>We are aiming to create a welcoming space at Queenâ€™s where researchers from all fields, and from any career stage, can relax and discuss reproducible practices and open science. Anyone with an interest is more than welcome to apply.</p>

<p>The first meetings will potentially be online, but we have also secured a physical address at QUBâ€™s beautiful Graduate School. Hope to see you there!</p>
