I"Á<p>It has been an absolutely amazing year for ReproducibiliTea. 
Starting with only a handful of journal clubs at the beginning of 2019, we now count 53 different constituent journal clubs in 17 diverse countries around the world. This has brought with it new opportunities and also new challenges. 
A stellar group of core ReproducibiliTeam members, who volunteer their time to keep ReproducibiliTea running, have taken it in their stride to build a functioning website and workflow that accommodates our rise in numbers, to offer support through our Slack community, to publish blog posts and to continually learn more about the unique challenges journal clubs face and how we can help tackle them.</p>
