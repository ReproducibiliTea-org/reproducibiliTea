I"¾<p>ReproducibiliTEA @Greenwich was launched in October 2020. We are a vibrant interdisciplinary community who meets to discuss classic and recent papers about reproducibility/replication, problems in the scientific system, meta-science, philosophy of science, and more.</p>

<p>The journal club takes place virtually every three weeks (Fridays 13.00-14.00) and is open to all: from those who have never heard of open science to experts; students of all levels and staff from all disciplines.</p>

<p>We are always looking for volunteers to lead paper discussions so please do get in touch if you have read an interesting paper that you would like to share with our group. As the journal club organizer, I am also very happy to make paper recommendations if you are not set on a specific paper but are keen to be involved.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, meetings are being held on Microsoft Teams. This means that, unfortunately, the teapot we have been generously provided with is yet to being used. We hope, however, that the online format will make our sessions accessible to even more interested attendees and highly encourage you to join us over lunch/tea. We cannot wait to meet everyone face to face soon.</p>
