I"»<p>ReproducibiliTea is a grassroots initiative, largely led by ECRs. 
ReproducibiliTea is evolving worldwide, and our steering committee needs to as well. 
In 2020, we set out plans for rotating the steering committee and posted a <a href="/posts/#ReproducibiliTea%20Steering%20Committee%20Application%20Announcement">call for applications</a> in December 2020. 
Now, we are excited to introduce you all to our updated steering committee!</p>
