I"ï<p>Join us on Twitch for a conversation about open science and tea! Micah Vandegrift and Sheila Saia will share their open science knowledge through an informal discussion, teaching concepts along the way. Anyone can watch the livestream, and if you have a free Twitch account, you can send your questions and comments in the live chat. Weâ€™re happy to answer your questions or refer you to someone who can help! Recordings of past streams are available on our twitch page after the event.</p>
