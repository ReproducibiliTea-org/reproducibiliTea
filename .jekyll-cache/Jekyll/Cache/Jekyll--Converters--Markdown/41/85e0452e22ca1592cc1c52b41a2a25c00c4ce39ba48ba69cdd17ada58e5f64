I"…<p>The TCD ReproducibiliTea journal club is currently tailored to early career researchers (i.e. PhD Students, Postdocs, Fellows), undergraduate/postgraduate students and senior academics within the realms of neuroimaging, psychology and neuroscience. We promote collaborative efforts to address the barriers impacting the reproducibility and replicability of studies and results in the aforementioned fields. We aim to leverage on the interdiscilinary experiences of the journal club to implement proposed solutions to critical problems in the literature and help researchers move a step closer towards open science in their own line of work.</p>

<p>The TCD ReproducibiliTea journal club will meet on a bi-weekly basis to discuss about a specific paper (chosen prior to the meeting) to understand the potential issues related but not limited to study design, sample size, publication bias, selective reporting and p-hacking. The journal club will also produce a series of podcasts to promote interactive discussions between early career researchers and senior academics/primary investigators (PIs) about their thoughts on reproducibility in research.</p>
