<p><em>Note: The current ReproducibiliTea Steering Group acknowledges that the current ReproducibiliTea leadership fails to be representative of our growing membership around the world. 
We are committed to try to ensure that we become more representative over time. 
As we currently still have a limited pool of possible Steering Group members we are not yet in a position to explicitly designate certain positions of the committee for certain groups of our membership. 
In the first application round 2020/21 we will therefore reach out directly to a wide range of ReproducibiliTea journal club organisers to encourage more diverse application, with the hope that we can take stronger action in the coming years.</em></p>
