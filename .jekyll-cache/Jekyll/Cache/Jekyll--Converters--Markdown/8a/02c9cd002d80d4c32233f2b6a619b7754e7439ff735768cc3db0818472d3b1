I""<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>ReproducibiliTea Nijmegen is organised by the local Open Science Community.
Like the community, the journal club is open to people from anywhere in the Nijmegen campus, regardless of affiliation or career stage.</p>

<h2 id="practical-information">Practical information</h2>

<p>We meet monthly every 3rd Wednesday of the month at 15.00. In each meeting, one person introduces the topic to be discussed (mostly papers but feel free to use your imagination here!), followed by discussion. Our topics are broad: if there’s something open science or reproducibility-related you’d like to discuss, you can lead a discussion.
If you’re interested, email us at contact@openscience-nijmegen.nl</p>

<p>If you’d like to join us check the schedule which will be posted on our <a href="https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/reproducibilitea/">website</a>. Meetings will also be announced on our mailing list. If you’ve not signed up already, you can do so <a href="https://openscience-nijmegen.nl/_pages/contact/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome! We want to hear from anyone who’s interested in reproducibility and open science, researchers and support staff alike. So come along for tea, open science, and friendly conversation :)</p>
